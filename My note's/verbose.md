"Upon deep and rigorous introspection, accompanied by the ceaseless examination of the multifaceted layers of epistemological inquiry, I have arrived at the profoundly humbling yet paradoxically enlightening realization that the totality of my cognitive faculties, insofar as they pertain to the acquisition, retention, and synthesis of knowledge, are fundamentally characterized by a pervasive absence of certitude or conclusive understanding. In this regard, I am acutely aware, with painstaking clarity, that any semblance of comprehension I may purport to possess is, in actuality, subsumed under the vast and insurmountable magnitude of my ignorance, which, in its very essence, eclipses all pretenses of knowing, rendering the scope of my awareness essentially void of substantive knowledge."

translation: I know that I know nothing.
