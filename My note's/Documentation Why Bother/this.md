| **Definition**             | A class is a blueprint or template that defines objects, encapsulating data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).                                             | A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called with arguments to operate on data.       |
| **Purpose**                | Used to model real-world entities by grouping related data and functions into a single unit. Supports object-oriented programming (OOP).                      | Used to perform a specific operation or calculation. It can be reused in different parts of a program.                 |
| **Components**             | Contains **data members** (attributes) and **member functions** (methods).                                                                                    | Contains only code (instructions) that operates on data passed to it (arguments).                                      |
| **Data Storage**           | Stores data in the form of attributes (variables) within an object.                                                                                           | Does not store data; only processes data passed as arguments or manipulates global variables.                          |
| **Object-Oriented**        | Yes. A class is central to OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.                                                                    | No. Functions are standalone blocks of code, not tied to object-oriented principles.                                   |
| **Instance Creation**      | Requires instantiation of an object to access its members (e.g., `Person p1;`).                                                                               | Does not require instantiation; can be called directly (e.g., `myFunction();`).                                        |
| **Encapsulation**          | Provides encapsulation by bundling data (attributes) and methods into one unit, controlling access to data via access specifiers (`public`, `private`, etc.). | Does not provide encapsulation; it only encapsulates a single behavior or task and may not restrict access to data.    |
| **Data and Behavior**      | Can represent both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) associated with an object.                                                                        | Represents only behavior, performing a specific task but not holding or managing data directly.                        |
| **Reusability**            | A class can be reused to create multiple objects, each with its own unique data but the same methods.                                                         | A function can be reused in different parts of a program by calling it with different arguments.                       |
| **Constructor/Destructor** | Has special functions like **constructors** (for initializing objects) and **destructors** (for cleaning up).                                                 | Functions donâ€™t have constructors or destructors; they are simply called and return control to the caller when done.   |
| **Memory**                 | Objects of a class can hold data in memory throughout their lifecycle. Memory is allocated when an object is created and deallocated when it is destroyed.    | Functions use memory temporarily for local variables during execution. Once the function returns, the memory is freed. |
| **Complexity**             | Classes are typically more complex as they can contain multiple data members, methods, constructors, and destructors.                                         | Functions are simpler, focusing on performing one task or computation at a time.                                       |
| **Inheritance**            | Supports **inheritance**, allowing one class to derive attributes and methods from another class.                                                             | Functions cannot inherit behavior; they are standalone blocks of code.                                                 |
