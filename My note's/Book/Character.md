#### Story
Bob was born poor in the periphery of the city. He lived with constant idea of the separation of the more noble parts of the city and where lived. The old story of "they have a lot and we have so little." However, he cares more with the fact that one day he looks not to the noble parts of the city, but outside of the city walls one day and sees a bit of light in the bog. Upon closer inspection, he finds this little village of hobgoblins, globins, and kobolds. It was not unheard of goblins in the city, but this was a different place that showed a bigger contrast. Golbins in the city were mainly thieves or lowly merchants dealing with less-than-honourable people.

#### Motivation
1. The society that he is in looks false, looks like its too perfect to be true. As they brand themselves as the "good ones". The character suspects that there is more than it meets the eye;
2. Even though it looks like a normal DnD city, the exact that that it looks like that is the reason why he suspects it is out of balance;
3. His mother (TBN) was a halfling, but his father was a goblin (TBN). He was a product of a normal relationship, but it will be portrayed by everyone else as rape or product of some charm that the goblin has cast upon his mother;

#### City
Medium size city (TBN) with max five citizens living in it. Some goblins are accepted at the very edge suburbs, but most of them are shoved to the wilderness to live in makeshift camps. The city is ruled by a high-elf nobleman, a prince, that is in line of succession. The city is a naval trade hub that is just below the capital city (TBN) that is inland. The general look of the city is something that looks between medieval and renaissance. There is a lot of new technology, but feudal structure is still very present.

#### Environment
Archipelago. The city is mostly surrounded by wetlands and bogs, some of which are polluted with city rejects and sewage.
