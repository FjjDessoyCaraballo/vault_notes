#### Keypoints:
1. **Scope:** what am I talking about? Limitations of the presentation;
	1. What am I talking about? How to better write documentation;
	2. How far? Mostly the way of communicating to a specific public;
	3. Anything else? Some tips and hacks, such as obsidian and READMEs;
	4. What am I not talking about? Where to specifically place your writings;
	5. Why? Because that becomes a case-by-case problem to be solved;
2. **Content:** we know the delimitation, but what is the actual content that is being delivered?
	1. _Who am I talking to?_ when one writes something, the planning phase before the actual writing must deliberate over what is the public that I am writing to. Examples:
		1. If one is writing specific comments in his code: even if you are writing comments inside a C specific project, the usage of specific lingo may hamper the understanding of beginners. Using technical terms should be done when necessary. Don't try to sound smart.
		2. If you are writing a README, it might be important to use the most accessible language possible. Even though you are in Github, designed for devs, Linda from HR is going through your pet projects to just have a general view of your stuff. Or maybe the team lead that was designed to filter applicants never touched C, and your README looks like this [[README]]. It should be unnecessary to say that this is not very promising and both people will not take that much effort to go through your code. They have 300 other applicants to look at.
		3. Again, even if your public is somehow acquainted to programming, easy language is a must if you want to help the general talent pool out there. Take man pages for example, some of them are ridiculously unhelpful because they are either badly written, or just not verbose enough.
	2. _Being verbose:_ writing everything out is a pain. You know what else is a pain? Figuring stuff out yourself. You do not have to sound as boring as Hobsbawn (boring historian, no need to look up), but you also can't just assume that everyone will know what you are talking about. For gods sake, we are not in academia, there is no need to be awfully rigorous about citing your sources (although is good depending on context), therefore use resources. Use visual aids; use tables; use lists. Make something like [[this]], [[or this]], or [[even like this]].
	3. _Unproblem the problem_: sounds stupid, but more important than being verbose is to solve the actual issue that brought you to writing about it in the first place. You did a program that has an algorithm to sort numbers? Cool, but why? What was the issue at hand that brought you to do this and why is it of any importance? It sounds like being verbose wound solve this issue, but sometimes some people like to be verbose for the sake of being [[verbose]].
3. **Structure:** We know the limits, we have content, but how are we wrapping this all together?
	1. Introduction: give them some eye-candy, fun examples, anecdotal examples. Something that is dumb, but illustrates the problem. Such as the [[README]] thing.
	2. Why is this even important? 
	3. Go over the content: pass the content part in a less extensive manner.
	4. Something practical: go over alternatives (software and methods) for documentation:
		1. Obsidian;
		2. Markdown;
		3. Doxygen;
	5. Practice: lets go over a real problem! Lets do our own documentation and writing exercise.
4. Possible FAQs (continued work)
