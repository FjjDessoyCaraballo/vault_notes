In C++, **inheritance** allows one class (the **derived class**) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (the **base class**). This promotes code reuse and provides a way to create more specialized versions of a generic class.

In this case, the **`ScavTrap` class inherits from `ClapTrap`**, meaning `ScavTrap` will have access to all the public and protected members (data and methods) of `ClapTrap`. The **private members** of `ClapTrap` are still part of each `ScavTrap` object, but they are inaccessible directly within `ScavTrap`â€”you can only access them through public or protected methods.

### ClapTrap Class Overview

The `ClapTrap` class is a generic base class representing a robot-like entity. It has:

- **Private attributes**: `_Name`, `_HP`, `_MP` (Mana Points or Energy Points), `_atkDmg` (attack damage), and `_target`.
- **Constructors**: For initializing `ClapTrap` objects.
- **Destructor**: A special method called when the object is destroyed.
- **Public methods**:
    - `attack`: Makes the `ClapTrap` attack a target.
    - `takeDamage`: Reduces the health points (HP) when taking damage.
    - `beRepaired`: Heals or repairs the `ClapTrap` by increasing its HP.
